    <h1>Kunhu Tales - A Rainy Day</h1>

    <p>“Mama, may I go and play, please?” Kunhu asked eagerly. But before her mother could say “no,” she got down from the verandah into the courtyard. The courtyard was full of water, and she started splashing around happily.</p>

    <p>By the time her mother arrived on the scene, Kunhu had splashed enough and was drenched like a bunny in spring rain.</p>

    <p>Seeing her mother, she began running through the water and called out, “Hey, tiny fish, take me, and let’s escape, or else mama will give us a timeout for sure!”</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the tiny fish hid in the water at first but then replied, “Hide quickly! Didn’t I tell you that mama’s gonna catch you?”</p>

    <p>Upon hearing that, Kunhu panicked and thought, “Oh no! We’re going to get caught for sure!”</p>

    <p>By then, her mother had already stepped into the water and caught her. Realizing there was no escape from the timeout, she shouted, “Papa, Mama won the race! Mama is the fastest! Mama is the best!”</p>

    <p>Her father, who had been reading the newspaper, came over to see what was happening.</p>

    <p>With both her parents there, Kunhu tried to figure out what to do to avoid getting in trouble. Her papa picked up a towel and started drying her hair.</p>

    <p>“Achoo! Achoo!” she sneezed, and her mother, still angry, said, “Didn’t I tell you not to go out in the rain? Now you’ve caught a cold!” Kunhu, not seeing any escape route, looked at her papa with a pitiful expression.</p>

    <p>But her papa was also not very happy. Just then, “Achoo!” she sneezed again.</p>

    <p>Her papa almost gave her a timeout, but that’s when the little one had an idea. “Hey, tiny fish, why aren’t you coming when I’m calling you? Don’t you want to meet my sweet papa and mama?”</p>

    <p>Hearing this, her papa asked, “When did you call the tiny fish?”</p>

    <p>By then, the tiny fish had quickly hidden under a leaf in the water.</p>

    <p>Kunhu sneezed again and said, “Now I’ve called! The tiny fish’s name is Achoo!”</p>

    <p>Hearing that, her papa and mama had to do their best to keep a straight face.</p>

    <p>Seeing them in a better mood, the little one asked with a very fake sad face, “Do you think I need to get a timeout for calling out for my friend?” Her parents couldn’t hold back their laughter anymore.</p>

    <p>They picked her up and took her inside.</p>

    <p>The tiny fish, seeing all this, smiled and continued swimming joyfully in the puddle in the yard.</p>

    <p>The End!</p>
